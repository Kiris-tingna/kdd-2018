\section{INTRODUCTION}
\par In modern society, watching movies is becoming a central part of consumer culture which makes the great earning of investments about movies. However, how to evaluate the reasonability of investments becomes an important problem for investors. Owing to complex film markets,  the success of a movie is closed related to audience reactions, screenplay, film types and starred actors(actress) or directors.  Before the movie release, we cannot guarantee it can be popular or not.
\par In recent years, with the heat of the film market, large amounts of money pour into film industry. Investments about movies consist of actors and directors salary,  film itself production. advertising fees etc. Actors and directors salary occupies a large proportion in cost of movie. However, the immaturity of the Chinese film market itself leads to a high-risk, high-reward investment environment.  Recently, the group acts of "fans" do not only create a great social effect, but also produce a huge economic benefit. Without bankable stars the film script aroused no interest. In order to pursue high profit, the usual way is to use a large number of "celebrities" to promote the box office through the fan effect but only a few were success. But it has caused the soaring star worth, the consequent increase in production costs. The reason is that in spite of massive "fans", the degree of match between fans and movies is the most important factor affecting the box office. Another is that box office is decided by actors, scripts, publicity, release schedule and other aspects, actors' contribution to the movie cannot be equal to box office. The lack of an effective quantitative method to assess the creative record of the box office contribution prevent investors from assess the investment star's rationality.
\par Besides the cost of production about movies, investors are concerned about box-office revenue. Recent years, the research on movies maily focuses on film box-office prediction\cite{marshall2013forecasting,basuroy2003critical,asur2010predicting}.

\par In recent years, the research on film mainly focuses on the construction of user-oriented movie recommendation system\cite{diao2014jointly,tang2015user}, sentiment analysis in reviews\cite{manek2017aspect,kiritchenko2014sentiment,pang2008opinion} and movie box office prediction\cite{marshall2013forecasting,basuroy2003critical,asur2010predicting} in three aspects.
The system for the Chinese movie market, providing an investor-oriented integrated emotional analysis, box office prediction, actor evaluation, box office contribution analysis of the analysis of the box office analysis of the movie, focusing on the protagonist, director, audience impact on the box office.
\subsection{Challenges and Solutions}
Considering improvements and new methods developed moving with time, natural language process (NLP) and deep learning (DL) is sharp solution in both data mining especially text mining and machine learning area. Based on modern technique, we proposed most valuable end-to-end analyse system Film Knowledge Analyse Platform (\system) which cover movie data of films. The main contribution of \system is finding state-of-art approach to traditional movie big data mining task. We summarized the key problem that evolved system \system focused on.
\newtheorem{difficulties}[theorem]{difficulty}
\begin{difficulties}
Given a comment, how do you analyze the names and emotions mentioned in this comment? \end{difficulties}
\par The existing sentiment analysis of movie reviews rarely seldom further analyzes the sentiment of the commentators. In social media, audiences may show different affective tendencies toward different protagonists of the movie, whereas traditional short text sentiment analysis can not capture these sentiments. To solve this problem, \system provides an object-oriented commentary sentiment analysis that performs named entity recognition and sentiment classification for each comment to more accurately capture the viewer's preference for a particular director (actor) of a particular movie.
\begin{difficulties}
How to quantify the director's contribution to the box office?
\end{difficulties}
\par Director (starring) contribution to the box office refers to the audience for the expectations of one or a few people to generate consumer spending movie tickets, analyze the contribution of a box office contribution to help get the actual business director or director value. In the analysis of the box office data, it is difficult to quantify the actual box office revenue of every star / director in a movie. There is also a lack of analysis of related modules in the existing commercial film analysis system.
\system provides a dynamic analysis module that accounts for the share of the box office's contribution, not only to quantify the box office's contribution but also to analyze the changes in the commercial value of a master before and after the release of the movie through changes in contributions over time.
\begin{difficulties} Joint value evaluation and replacability among actors.\end{difficulties}
\par Since effect of an actor suffer multi uncertainties and how to make a joint-evaluation of actor impact is a big question. A lot of method focus on giving linear weight for each factor. But this weight might change and impractical when goal of analysis changing. In \system, we mining joint value based on relationship among actors using heterogeneous network. Qualifying similarity and measuring increase of influence by co-star of two specific actor for target film show great power on practicability of the system which enhance availability and effectiveness of \system a lot.

\subsection{Roadmap}
The rest of this paper is organized as follows, Section \ref{sec:overviw} presents an overview of \system. In section \ref{sec:analyse} we show integration preprocessing on heterogenous movie data and elaborate disambiguation of actors' names by construct personas. In section \ref{sec:sent} we further study name entities recognition based on disambiguation and then describe how \system extract target-dependent sentiments and analyse changeable trend on sentiment. Section \ref{sec:impact} presents dynamic impact of leader creators based on both sentiments and self attributes. In section \ref{sec:predict} present the core value of system by phased prediction of movies which helps to maximum box-office based on reasonable investments now and future. Section \ref{sec:evo} presents system evaluation as well as the case study. In section \ref{sec:related}, we introduce the related work. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclu} concludes the paper.
