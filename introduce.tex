\section{INTRODUCTION}
\par Big film data stands for big capacity and big value where capacity is the sum of total information bought by one movie online and value is the instructive finding of latent target interests or tendency behind data representation. From investment to profit, movie data analyse play an important role in maximizing interest both investors and audiences. x.x.x.

\subsection{Challenges and Solutions}
Considering improvements and new methods developed moving with time, natural language process (NLP) and deep learning (DL) is sharp solution in both data mining especially text mining and machine learning area. Based on modern technique, we proposed most valuable end-to-end analyse system Film Knowledge Analyse Platform (\system) which cover movie data of films. The main contribution of \system is finding state-of-art approach to traditional movie big data mining task. We summarized the key problem that evolved system \system focused on.
