\begin{abstract}
    The return on investment (ROI) analysis about movies is a challenging but important task for movie investors in their decision making process. For investors, they are expected to get high box-office revenue with appropriate investments. Apart from movie special effects, most of investments are used to remuneration for movie actors(actress). Due to complicated factors such as audience reactions, screenplay, film types etc, it's not easy for investors to estimate upfront ROI, which makes film investment a gamble. Although most current research works aim to predict box-office revenue more specific, they can not provide investors more direct profits information about the success of the movie they would like to invest.
    \par In this paper, we design and implement an integreated system, called Social Network Investment Platform (a.k.a \system), that aims to do some analysis of movies for investors. \system provides various modules for users to predict box-office, capture public opinion about a film, assess the value of the actor, monitor the changes of the ratio of box-office about actors, assess actor replacement and so on.
