Box-office forecasting is a challenging but import task for movie contributors in their decision making process. Empirical studies of the determinants of box office revenues have mostly focused on post-production factors - that is, ones known after the film has been completed and/or released with audience reactions. Early in \cite{liu2006word} shows that word of mouth (WOM) can help explain box office revenue. The results of experiments from \cite{kim2015box} show that the utilization of SNS data can improve he forecasting accuracies of machine learning-based algorithms and their combination. \cite{hunter2016predicting} regard the textual and content analysis of the screenplays of films as chief among the pre-production factors. \cite{hur2016box} presents new box-office forecasting models to enhance the forecasting accuracy by utilizing review sentiments and employing non-linear machine learning algorithms.
