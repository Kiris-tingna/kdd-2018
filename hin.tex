\section{Mining Movie Heterogeneous Network}
\par In order to discover important relation and promotion between two actors, we focus on mining movie heterogeneous information network. Discovering interesting topology of network provide great insight about the system innate character. A movie heterogeneous information network (\emph{MHIN}) is a domain information network with multiple types of entities and relations. We construct our \emph{MHIN} with multiple objects such as movies (M), directors (D), users (U), Actors (A), Types (T) and box-offices (B). Figure \ref{fig:mhin} shows typical \emph{MHIN} schema defined by us. Links exist between users and movies denoting score and score-by relations, between movies and actors(directors) denoting star(direct) and star-by(direct-by) relations, between movies and types denoting label and (labeled) relations, between movies and box-offices denoting gain and gain by relations. Also, we can add other attributes into the movie heterogeneous network (e.g years (Y), producers (P)). Meta-path is a connect relation between two types of objects in \emph{MHIN}. Denote network schema for our \emph{MHIN} is $\mathcal{S}=(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R})$, where $\mathcal{A}$ represent object types and $\mathcal{R}$ indicate different types of relationships. A meta-path $\mathcal{P}$ is defined in the form of $A_1 \xrightarrow{R_1} A_2\xrightarrow{R_2} \dots\xrightarrow{R_k} A_{k+1}$. Length of $\mathcal{P}$ is defined by number of relations it contains. Semantic composite relations are implied in meta-paths. For example, we can evaluate the similarity of movies or actors by length-2 meta-path MDM (movie-director-movie), MAM (movie-actor-movie) or AMA (actor-movie-actor), AMTMA(actor-movie-type-movie-actor).

\subsection{Rank Based Cluster For Actors}
In this section, we introduce a way to make distinguish between A-list and B-list actors. We prefer applying cluster based classifier on actors popularity recognition. Strong available mutually reinforcing relations between cluster and rank are helpful to deal with different levels of actors. We defined recursion formula by following empirical rules.
\newtheorem{rules}[theorem]{rule}
\begin{rules} high rank actors star more high rank movies\end{rules}
\begin{rules} high rank movies attract more high rank actors\end{rules}
\begin{rules} actors get high rank with high rank co-starers\end{rules}

Suppose we want $K$ clusters of actors. According the star relationship between actors and movies, we define matrix $M_{MA}(i, j)=c_{ij}$ representing actor $j$'s contribution of movie $i$ (see Section 3.1) and similarly, $M_{AA}(i, j)= m_{ij}$ stands for number of movies that actor $i$ and actor $j$ co-stared. Note that $W_{AM} = W_{MA}^T$, and $i=\{1,2,\dots, m\}, j=\{1,2,\dots, n\}$. According the 3 rules we proposed, we have

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  r_{A}(i) = \alpha \sum_{i=1}^{m}W_{AM}&(j, i)r_M(i) + (1-\alpha)\sum_{j=1}^{n}W_{AA}(i, j)r_A(j)\\
  r_{A}(j) &\leftarrow \frac{r_{A}(j)}{\sum_{j'=1}^{n}r_{A}(j')}\\
  r_{M}(i) &= \sum_{j=1}^{n}W_{MA}(i, j)r_A(j)\\
  r_{M}(i) &\leftarrow \frac{r_{M}(i)}{\sum_{i'=1}^{m}r_{M}(i')}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Note that $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is a believe factor of weighed component of rule 3,  $r_{A}(j)$ and $r_{M}(i)$ are normalized rank score vector. We finally get $r_A$ which should be primary eigenvector of $\alpha W_{AM}W_{MA} + (1-\alpha) W_{AA}$. Further, we capture posterior probability $\pi_{i,k}$ that $a_i$ from cluster $k$, Once an actor acts a movie, he is more likely to star high ranked film and for movie, its success are more likely contributed by high rank actor. Thus we have K dimensional vector $s_{a_i} = \{\pi_{i,1}, \pi_{i,2}, \dots, \pi_{i,K}\}$ where $\pi_{i,k}$ denotes $a_i$'s coefficient for component $k$.

The cluster center and the distance between each actor and each cluster can be defined as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  S_{A_k} &= \frac{\sum_{a \in A}s(a)}{|A_k|} \\
  Distance(a, A_k) &= 1-\cos(s_{a_i}, S_{A_k})
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Alternative Actors}
In this section, we discuss method choosing alternative actors for casting agents. The basic idea is measure similarity between actors. Since movie information network has been built, we then introduce meta path-based similarity framework for alternative actors. The example is show in table \ref{tab:metapath}.

\begin{table}[!htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
  \hline
  Type & Path instance & Meta-path \\
  \hline
  I(\emph{AMA})& Andy-$M_1$-Sara & \tabincell{c}{Actor-\\Movie-Actor}  \\
  \hline
  II(\emph{AMTMA}) & \tabincell{c}{John-$M_2$-Comedy-$M_3$-Sara\\Ben-$M_4$-War-$M_3$-Sara\\Drew-$M_5$-Dracula-$M_2$-John} & \tabincell{c}{Actor-Movie-\\Type-Movie\\-Actor} \\
  \hline
  III(\emph{AMDMA}) & \tabincell{c}{Diana-$M_6$-Spielberg-$M_1$-Andy\\John-$M_2$-Luc Besson-$M_5$-Drew\\Sara-$M_3$-Tom Tykwer-$M_5$-Drew} & \tabincell{c}{Actor-Movie-\\Director-Movie\\-Actor}\\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Different Types of meta-path in MHIN}
  \label{tab:metapath}
\end{table}

Denote actors $a_1$ and $a_2$ then $p_{a_1 \rightsquigarrow a_2}$ is a path instance between $a_1$ and $a_2$, $p_{a_1 \rightsquigarrow a_1}$ is a path instance between $a_1$ and $a_1$, $p_{a_2 \rightsquigarrow a_2}$ is a path instance between $a_2$ and $a_2$. We then get similarity between $a_1$ and $a_2$ by calculate

\begin{equation}
  s(a_1,a_2) = \frac{2 \times |\left\{p_{a_1 \rightsquigarrow a_2}: p_{a_1 \rightsquigarrow a_2} \in \mathcal{P} \right\}|}{|\left\{p_{a_1 \rightsquigarrow a_1}: p_{a_1 \rightsquigarrow a_1} \in \mathcal{P} \right\}| + |\left\{p_{a_2 \rightsquigarrow a_2}: p_{a_2 \rightsquigarrow a_2} \in \mathcal{P} \right\}|}
\end{equation}

Base on this measure of actors, we can not only know similarities but also get multi metrics that reflect how actors link with others. Query a specific actor $a_i$and then return a recommend actor list $r_{a_i}$ that ordered by similarities. Investors can determine the scope of film plan or prepare backup candidate for chief actor. In \system we also analyse different types of meta path instances for providing comprehensive alternative information for other actors.
