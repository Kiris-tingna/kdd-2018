\section{INTRODUCTION}
\par Big film data stands for big capacity and big value where capacity is the sum of total information bought by one movie online and value is the instructive finding of latent target interests or tendency behind data representation. From investment to profit, movie data analyse play an important role in maximizing interest both investors and audiences. x.x.x.\\
In recent years, with the heat of the movie market to increase, a large number of capital influx movie industry. However, the film industry in China is still in its development stage, and the immature market has made movie investment characterized by high risk and high returns. In order to pursue high incomes, the usual way is to use a large number of "celebrities" to promote the box office through the fan effect. At that time, only a few of the works were successful. But it has caused the soaring star worth, the consequent increase in production costs. The reason, Star Bowl although there is a huge fan base, but the star match with the degree of work, star fan characteristics match with the extent of the work is the most important factor affecting the box office. Actors, scripts, publicity, release schedule and other aspects of the combined effect of the results to measure the level of contribution to the box office record can not be obtained directly from the available data, the existing method is the lack of an effective quantitative method to assess the creative record of the box office Contribution value, thus helping investors to assess the investment star's rationality.\\
\subsection{Challenges and Solutions}
Considering improvements and new methods developed moving with time, natural language process (NLP) and deep learning (DL) is sharp solution in both data mining especially text mining and machine learning area. Based on modern technique, we proposed most valuable end-to-end analyse system Film Knowledge Analyse Platform (\system) which cover movie data of films. The main contribution of \system is finding state-of-art approach to traditional movie big data mining task. We summarized the key problem that evolved system \system focused on.
\newtheorem{difficulties}[theorem]{difficulty}
\begin{difficulties}
The lack of quantitative methods to measure the degree of box office contribution to a famous starring or director. \end{difficulties} 
\begin{difficulties} Inaccurate results of box office forecast. \end{difficulties}
\begin{difficulties} Joint value evaluation and replacability among actors.\end{difficulties}

\subsection{Roadmap}
The rest of this paper is organized as follows, Section \ref{sec:overviw} presents an overview of \system. In section \ref{sec:analyse} we show integration preprocessing on heterogenous movie data and elaborate disambiguation of actors' names by construct personas. In section \ref{sec:sent} we further study name entities recognition based on disambiguation and then describe how \system extract target-dependent sentiments and analyse changeable trend on sentiment. Section \ref{sec:impact} presents dynamic impact of leader creators based on both sentiments and self attributes. In section \ref{sec:predict} present the core value of system by phased prediction of movies which helps to maximum box-office based on reasonable investments now and future. Section \ref{sec:evo} presents system evaluation as well as the case study. In section \ref{sec:related}, we introduce the related work. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclu} concludes the paper.
